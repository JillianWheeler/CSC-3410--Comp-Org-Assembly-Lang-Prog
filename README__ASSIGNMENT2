Hello!

Welcome to my assignment 2 for CSC 3410.

There are four seperate .asm's that are in this tarball. 
The adding, multiplying, division, and swapping programs.

I used the provided document as well as the video lectures to aid in this 
assignment.

I also used rescources such as stackoverflow, youtube, and other
program learning sites. 

To compile use these commands:

nasm -g -f elf -F dwarf -o p1.o p1.asm
ld p1.o -m elf_i386 -o p1

To run the program simply type:
./p1

Just replace p1 with whatever number of the assignment it is!
